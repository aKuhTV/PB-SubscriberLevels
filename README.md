# ⭐ PB-SubRanks ⭐

The SubRanks Module is a highly customizable extension for Phantombot, that lets you set Ranks based on the *total* amount of months a viewer has been subscribed to your channel. (This extension is built with Twitchs new sub system in mind.)
You can either use this extension just as some kind of sub-age command, similar to followage, or you can also set (funny) names for each sub-month (like levels) to engage people to resub. The module will detect if the user is actively subbed at the moment and if that's not the case the level will not be displayed (might be an option in the future tho, if requested).  
  
This uses part of the existing ranks system of Phantombot. Existing Custom Ranks will be backed up and replaced by Sub Ranks, but can still be used on a per-user basis. (See Wiki page "Commands") Plus you can use the (rank) tag in standard commands, like !points, and it will give you the sub rank.
